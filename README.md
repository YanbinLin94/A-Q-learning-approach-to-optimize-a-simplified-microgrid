# a-single-Q-learning-agent-to-optimize-a-simplied-microgrid
 This code only provides a single Q learning agent to optimize a simplied microgrid (energy arbitrage) setup. The reference paper below described a recent work of aggregating multiple learning agents for microgrid energy optimization during the extreme weather events, which is more complicated than what you can observe from this code.
