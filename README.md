# A-single-Q-learning-agent-to-optimize-a-simplified-microgrid
This code provides a single Q learning agent to optimize a simplified microgrid (energy arbitrage) setup. The reference paper below describes a recent work of aggregating multiple learning agents for microgrid energy optimization during extreme weather events, which is more complicated than what you can observe from this code.
